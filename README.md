# Nonlinear-MPC-for-Trajectory-Tracking
This repository contains Python codes using ROS and Gazebo for implementation of proposed Nonlinear Model Predictive Control method for collision-free and deadlock-free trajectory tracking of multiple nonholonomic wheeled mobile robots. For each scenario, you need to first launch a Gazebo simulation with proper initial pose in the environment. Then, you launch your Python code for each scenario. Please feel free to contact me if you have any question or any issue with implementation of the codes.
